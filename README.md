Highrise Hostel is our hostel with hectic, complex physical management system, and all sorts of tedious paperwork. We aimed at simplifying the whole process, and redirecting it to an efficient & accessible to all platform.

Roles:

There are 3 roles,
1. Admin - Has the authority to register student, and warden
2. Warden - Has the authority to approve/decline student's leave applications.
3. Student - Has the authority to view their leave application's status (either approved or declined); Apply for leave form.


Features:

1. Our, AWT project (HighRise Hostel Application), allows all the student to apply for their leave. Once the decision is made by the warden regarding the leave application the student can view the decision made by the warden in their respective home page.
2. Our project also allows the Hostel Warden to review the Leave application of the student, and also can make a decision to accept/decline it. The warden is also able to view all the complaints raised by the students and the warden can also mark the attendance of the studentâ€™s if required. All the new leave application form and new complaints raised will be displayed on the home page of the warden.
3. There is also a feature for the admin to register a new student and a new warden if required.
4. Authorisation is maintained using protected routes. 

InProgress:
1. Add Complaints, attendance feature for both warden, and student.
